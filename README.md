# WORK IN PROGRESS - Not yet functional

This project might evolve in a more consequent BAC/PACE passport reader.

For now, my main goal is to be able to compile Open PACE and understand how I can use it in Android Studio.

The idea would be to have a working version of Example.java that can be run from Android Studio.

I will try to make it work and report my findings there. Please feel free to contact me if you have some tips for me, problems when trying to compile or run things.

Last edits:

- Currently **I can't yet build the Android Studio project** because of some errors in the libraries. For sure, I made mistakes in the .so calls
- I have been able to succesfully compile the latest OpenPACE version for Android. You can refer to the wiki page Compiling-OpenPACE-for-Android that I will try to keep updated with the latest information I find.
